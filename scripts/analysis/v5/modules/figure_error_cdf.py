"""Error-distance CDF, one curve per method, log x. Ported from v4.

The companion to the outcome bars. Those say *where* a prediction landed --
which serving region, which ring, or no answer. They cannot say *how far off*
it was, and the two can disagree: a method rarely in the right cell may still
be consistently close, and one often in the right cell may have a catastrophic
tail. The disagreement is the finding, so the package needs both halves.

## Distance to the TG, not to the seed

The column is `pred_dist_to_tg_km`: prediction to the raw TG coordinate. v5
also writes `pred_dist_to_seed_km`, but the seeds are regrouped at every rung,
so that distance moves with the grid. The TG distance does not -- the answer
space defines the labels and stays out of a distance that has its own ground
truth. So the figure is identical at every rung, and the artifacts carry **no
`healpix-<n>` in their names** and land in the rung-free parent of the rung
directories (`classify/`). `test_figure_error_cdf` re-checks the premise
against real runs.

## Unanswered rows are excluded

A `FALLBACK` row still carries a coordinate -- the shortest-ping VP's -- so
filtering on NaN will not drop it, and pooling it would pull a method's curve
toward the baseline exactly where the method failed. `status.solved_mask` is
the shared predicate, the one `classify.summarize` applies before taking
`pred_dist_to_tg_km_p50`/`p90`. Those rows are the outcome bars' dark-grey "no
answer" segment, so the population behind a curve here is that figure's
non-grey stack, method for method. The `plotted/total` column in the
percentile box shows where a curve rests on a subset (VAN, with its
fallbacks).

It also carries the case a hand-written filter gets wrong: S-P's rows are all
`BASELINE`, never `SUCCESS`, so `status == "SUCCESS"` would empty the baseline.

## ...unless they are parked at the 10,000 km sentinel

`--unanswered sentinel` puts every unanswered row back in at `SENTINEL_KM`
instead of dropping it, so each curve is drawn over the same denominator --
the whole TG roster -- and reaches y=1 only at the sentinel. A method's refusal
rate then reads straight off the figure: the height of its curve just left of
the sentinel line is the fraction it answered. `exclude` cannot show that,
because there every curve reaches 1 on its own population and VAN's refusals
are invisible in the shape.

The cost is that the percentiles move with the policy, and a censored one is
not a distance anyone measured -- it means "this method had not answered that
share of its TGs yet". A censored cell prints the sentinel plainly, so the
footnote and the labelled sentinel line carry that reading; the CSV declares
`unanswered_policy`/`sentinel_km`, and the artifacts take a `.sentinel.` infix
so the two populations cannot overwrite each other. Only the `exclude` files
join to `accuracy.csv`.

## Pooling concatenates rows; it cannot average percentiles

`--layout pooled` draws one curve per method over every selected run's solved
rows at once -- a micro-pool, so a dataset weighs by its TG count. Averaging
the runs' published p50s is a different quantity, and on as01-03 it reverses
the leader (SOI first at 96.1 km pooled; OCT-H first on the mean of p50s). A
method enters only if **every** run scored it, and TG ids are checked
disjoint.

## The baseline is dark grey and dashed

S-P is drawn recessive, because the CDF shows the CBG methods *against* a
reference. The grey is `_INK_2`, **not** `methods.OTHER_HUE` (== `_MUTED`):
any unpublished method falls into that bucket, and a baseline sharing its hex
would be told apart by the dash alone.

Command: `plot-error-cdf`.
