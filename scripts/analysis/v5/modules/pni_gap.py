"""How far a TG is from its operator's nearest PNI, against the S-P gap, clustered.

`figure_vp_distance_cdf` shows that the smallest-RTT VP is often not the
nearest VP: `gap = d_sp - d_geo` is zero for a fifth of TGs and reaches
4,000 km for others. This module asks whether the gap follows **where the
operator interconnects**: for each TG, the great-circle distance to the
nearest PNI in an operator-supplied list (`d_pni`), set against its gap. Then
it clusters the TGs on those two axes (Ward by default, k-means on request) and
writes the grouping to disk,
so the RTT box figure (`figure_pni_cluster_rtt`) reads the same clusters that
were drawn instead of recomputing them.

## The PNI list is an input, not a benchmark artifact

The benchmark has no idea where an operator peers. The list is passed in
(`--pni-csv`, columns `pni_id, pni_lat, pni_lon`) and validated here. Its
sha256 is in the manifest, and the output directory is keyed on its file stem,
so two PNI lists for one run cannot overwrite each other. On as01 the list is
marked `.approx`: facility coordinates, not the router's.

## The clustering unit is a scatter point, not a TG

~20 IP replicas share a site and share its VP geometry exactly, so they are
one observation repeated. A **point** is one distinct `(site, gap)` pair: one
per site, except where replicas at one site pick different smallest-RTT VPs
(as01 San Jose splits 15/5). Clustering runs on the points **unweighted**.
Weighting by TG count would let a 20-replica site outvote a split site's
5-replica point for no reason except the replica count. `n_tgs` travels with
each point for marker size, and every TG inherits its point's cluster.

## Clustering runs in the plotted geometry

The scatter draws both axes symlog: linear 0-100 km, log above. Both methods
are Euclidean, so they run on the **same** transform (`symlog_units`,
matplotlib's own `SymmetricalLogTransform` with the axes' parameters). Two
points that look close on the figure are close to the clustering, and a
cluster boundary can be read
straight off the picture. On raw km the 0-100 km block, which holds more than
half of as01's points, would be one dot beside a 4,000 km gap.

## Ward, not k-means, by default

`--method ward` (default) is agglomerative clustering with Ward linkage;
`--method kmeans` is k-means. Both minimise within-cluster variance, and on
each of as01, as02 and as03 alone they give identical partitions. Pooled over
the three, they differ on one point, and k-means is the one that gets it
wrong. A 7-replica AS03 point (123 km from a PNI, 79 km gap) sits 0.29 units
from the other 13 replicas of its own site, which are in the large
far-from-PNI cluster. k-means puts it in a 5-point cluster instead, because a
5-point cluster's centroid is dragged toward each of its members, this one
included. Its silhouette there is the only negative one of 80. Ward merges it
with its site first, and the pooled silhouette rises from 0.715 to 0.734.

Ward is deterministic, so it has no seed to check. The manifest instead
records the **other** method's partition at the same k and its adjusted Rand
index against the reported one, and names every point the two disagree on.

## Choosing k, and what the number is worth

`k` defaults to the silhouette argmax over `K_CANDIDATES`, computed with the
chosen method; ties go to the smaller k. On as01 that is 3 (0.77, against 0.69 at k=2 and 0.70 at k=6).
`--k` overrides. The whole silhouette curve is in the manifest, because with
this few points the runner-up is never far behind.

The number of points is what limits the result: as01 has 24 points at 20
sites, and two of its three clusters hold 3 and 7 points (2 and 5 sites).
Under k-means, refitting from `STABILITY_SEEDS` other seeds and comparing each
by adjusted Rand index checks that the partition does not depend on
initialisation. Neither method's checks say anything about sampling variance,
which with ~20 sites is large.

## Clusters are numbered by size, not by the algorithm

Raw cluster labels are arbitrary (k-means' change with the seed). Here clusters are
renumbered `1..k` by **site count descending** (ties: TG count descending,
then centroid gap and `d_pni` ascending), so `C1` is the cluster covering the
most sites and the numbering is stable across reruns. Sites rather than TGs,
because replicas are one observation repeated.

## The clusters are geometric, not mechanistic

On as01 both methods put Hillsboro (235 km from a PNI, 3,922 km gap) with the
far-from-PNI sites, not with SeaTac (19 km, 3,848 km), even though Hillsboro
and SeaTac share the same smallest-RTT VP and a >= 59 ms RTT floor. `d_pni` is
what separates them. The RTT box figure is there to show whether each cluster
also shares a latency regime. Do not read "same cluster" as "same cause".

## Privacy

Outputs carry no coordinate and no place name: TG ids, distances, RTTs,
cluster numbers. PNI ids name cities, so they stay out of the output as well.

## Pooling

`--layout pooled` merges several runs into one scatter and one clustering. Each
run is measured against **its own** PNI list first (`d_pni` against another
operator's PNIs means nothing), then the points are concatenated. Sites stay
keyed on `(run_id, lat, lon)`, so a facility two runs share is two points, and
no TG id may appear in two runs (`cross.guard_disjoint_tgs`). The manifest
records every run's CSV and PNI-list sha256, and `clusters_by_run` says which
runs each pooled cluster is made of.

Command: `plot-pni-gap`. Writes `<run>/pni-gap/<pni-stem>/` per run, and
`_cross/pni-gap/<n>-runs-<hash>/` pooled.
