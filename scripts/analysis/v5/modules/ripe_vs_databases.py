"""CBG methods against the commercial geolocation databases, on one CDF.

The IMC 2023 paper's Figure 7 asks the question this figure asks: a CBG curve
is only worth drawing if the reader can see what it is competing with. A
measurement-based method that lands inside 40 km half the time sounds good
until an IP-to-location lookup -- free, instant, no vantage points -- does
better on the same targets.

Two databases ride along, both shipped in `datasets/static_datasets/` and both
keyed by anchor IPv4, which is exactly this package's `tg_id`:

  * `ip_info_geo_anchors.json`    -- IPinfo, a `loc: "lat,lon"` string per IP
  * `maxmind_free_geo_anchors.json` -- MaxMind GeoLite2 free, a `[lat, lon]` pair

## They are series, not methods

A database has no combo id, no fold, and nothing was fitted: the same lookup
answers every target in every fold. So it gets no position in
`methods.TERM_ORDER` and no hue from the validated six-term palette -- widening
that palette would re-order the legend of every other figure in the package for
the sake of this one. The terms, hues and dashes live here instead, and
`figure_error_cdf.plot_cdf` takes them through its `order` / `style_fn` hooks.
They are drawn dashed and dash-dot for the same reason the S-P baseline is:
they are the reference, not the result.

## The same distance, the same population

The CBG curves are `figure_error_cdf.load_errors` unchanged -- the identical
arrays behind `error_cdf.png`, so a number here and a number there cannot
disagree. The database curves are computed the same way the benchmark computes
`pred_dist_to_tg_km`: great-circle from the looked-up coordinate to the TG's
own `tg_lat`/`tg_lon`, read out of the scored parquet rather than re-derived
from the corpora, so both sides of the comparison use one ground truth.

A TG the database has no record for is **unanswered**, not an error of zero or
infinity -- the same status a CBG method's FALLBACK gets. Under the default
`exclude` policy it drops out and the database curve rests on its own
population; under `sentinel` it re-enters at 10,000 km, and the height of the
curve at the sentinel is the database's coverage. `n_solved` in the CSV is the
covered count, so a curve drawn on partial coverage is never silently read as a
full one. On the RIPE anchor roster both databases cover every TG, so today the
two policies differ only in the CBG methods' refusals. `cut`, the paper's
policy, keeps the unanswered rows in the denominator and stops each curve at
its last answer, as in `figure_error_cdf`.

## Styled as the paper's error CDF, in km

No title (the caption names the figure), decade ticks as 10^k and no km
reference verticals, like the normalized error CDF. The axis itself stays in
km: this is the public RIPE dataset, which needs no normalization.

Command: `plot-ripe-vs-databases`.
