"""How far out each method is on the targets only *it* got right.

The companion to `figure_error_diff`, and its complement: that one compares
the two where both placed the target in the correct cell, this one looks at
the two cohorts where exactly one did. Together with the targets neither
reached they partition every evaluated target -- 565 both, 243 Spotter only,
236 Octant-Hull only, 225 neither, of 1,269.

## The claim

Spotter's exclusive wins are bought at distances Octant-Hull never reaches.
Its median offset on them is 4 grids against Octant-Hull's 1.5, its 90th
percentile 11 against 6.5, and its worst 35 grids -- about 1,780 km -- where
Octant-Hull's exclusive cohort stops at 8. Those are the peripheral sites
whose cells are large enough that a nearest-seed verdict credits a prediction
most of a continent away.

And the far tail is a small part of it. 13.6% of Spotter's exclusive cohort
lies beyond 10 grids, which is 2.6% of all evaluated targets. The curve says
so: it is already at 0.86 where Octant-Hull's has ended.

## Each curve against its own cohort

The two are normalised separately, so the y axis reads "of the predictions
this method got right and the other did not, what share is this close". That
is the comparison the shapes are for. It is deliberately *not* a share of all
targets -- the cohorts are nearly the same size (19.1% and 18.6%) and putting
both on a common denominator would compress the tail this figure exists to
show. The sizes are in the manifest.

## Symmetric log, for the zeros

Octant-Hull lands 31 of its exclusive targets in the target's own grid, an
offset of exactly 0, which a log axis cannot draw. `symlog` with a one-grid
linear window shows them and still separates a tail that runs to 35. Spotter
has no such target: it never answers in the right grid on a target
Octant-Hull missed.

## What it does not say

Nothing about whether either method is *right* to be credited at those
distances -- that is the evaluation section's argument, and this figure is
the measurement under it.

Command: `plot-exclusive-error`. Needs `build-answer-space` and `classify` on
every run. Writes `_cross/exclusive-error/<datasets>[@<arm>]/`.
