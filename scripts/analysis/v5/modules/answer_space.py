"""The TG answer space: a grid partition and a cell partition.

v4's answer space had one partition, the HEALPix grid, and graded a prediction
by `ring` -- how many grids out it landed. That bounds the **distance** but is
blind to **direction**: a miss one ring out lands either inside the TG's own
serving region or in a neighbour's, and an operator cares which.

v5 adds the second partition. Both are built at one tolerance, `grid_km`:

* **grid** -- HEALPix pixels at nside, `grid_km = sqrt(area)` across.
* **cell** -- the Voronoi cell of each **seed**, unbounded. Seeds are the
  spherical centroids of sites grouped by complete linkage with diameter
  `grid_km`. Also called the serving region: people are served by the nearest
  site.

A prediction then carries two labels: `ring` against the grid partition and
`cell_label` against the cell partition (see `classify`).

## The cell partition is unbounded, deliberately

Every point on Earth is nearest to some seed, so `cell_label` alone will call
a prediction thousands of km away "correct" whenever it happens to fall on the
right side of a distant bisector. That is not a defect to patch here: it is
the property the evaluation measures, by reading `ring` beside `cell_label`.
Nothing in this module restricts where a cell may reach.

## A traffic-weighted run is built over its mesh

Its evaluated TGs are the ones that survived the flow filter, a subset of the
mesh. The answer space is built over the **mesh** (the config's
`mesh_csv_path`) and only the evaluated TGs are scored against it, so the
weighted arm and its mesh arm share one set of sites, seeds and cells and differ
only in who is scored. Built from the evaluated TGs instead, dropped sites would
lose their seeds and hand their cells to neighbours -- a cell-label gain every
method gets for free. `require_mesh_universe` refuses a weighted space built the
old way. Ported from v3, which had this; v4 lost it.

## Glossary

`GLOSSARY` below is binding for every name in v5 and is written into every
`meta.json` and manifest, so an artifact carries its own definitions.

## Artifacts

`grids.csv` (occupied grids), `sites.csv`, `seeds.csv`, `tgs.csv` (one row per
TG, with its site, grid and seed), and `meta.json`.
