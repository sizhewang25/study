"""Where a cohort's predictions actually landed: one map per method x dataset.

The outcome bars say *how many* predictions fell in the right serving region.
They cannot say **where**, and on these meshes that is the interesting half:
two methods can hold the same `cell_label` share while one is right about the
coasts and wrong about the interior and the other is the reverse. This module
draws the predictions themselves, one panel per `(method, dataset)`, rows =
method and columns = dataset, so a reader compares down a column.

## One cohort per figure

`correct` and `wrong` are drawn as two separate figures rather than two marker
shapes on one. Overlaying them doubles the ink in exactly the metros where the
map is already unreadable (see the known limitation below), and the two read
differently anyway: on the `correct` map a cell's number is "predictions that
landed here and belonged here", on the `wrong` map it is "predictions that
should have landed here and did not". Same keying, opposite sense; one legend
cannot carry both. Rejected: one figure with `o`/`X` overlaid, and a third
`unanswered` cohort -- an unanswered row has no coordinate, so it has nothing
to draw.

## The frame is shared, and it is an argument

`extent` defaults to `DEFAULT_EXTENT`, wider than `mapping.US_MAINLAND_EXTENT`
because SPO's predictions run into Canada and out over the Gulf. It is one
frame for all eighteen panels on purpose: a per-panel `mapping.auto_extent`
would rescale every panel to its own data, and a reader comparing OCT-H's
column against SPO's would be comparing two different maps at two different
scales. A prediction outside the frame is **not dropped** -- it is drawn as a
dark-red caret pinned at the edge and counted in the title (as01/SPO: 20 of
354 `correct`), because silently cropping the worst predictions is how a map
flatters a method.

## solved_mask, and the 107 rows it removes

A FALLBACK row carries the S-P baseline's coordinate, not the method's, so it
is filtered by `status.solved_mask` before anything is drawn or counted.
Without that mask as01/VAN's `correct` count reads 270 instead of 163 -- 107
rows of the baseline's accuracy credited to the variant. The excluded count is
printed in each panel title (`N FB excl.`) rather than left implicit, so the
denominator is visible where the number is.

## Counts key on `tg_seed_id`

The number drawn by a seed is the count of *that cohort's TGs whose own seed
is this one*, never `pred_seed_id`. On the `correct` map the two agree by
definition. On the `wrong` map they do not, and `tg_seed_id` is the one an
operator asks for: "how many of this region's targets did the method lose?"
Keying on `pred_seed_id` would answer "how many strays landed here", which is
a different figure and one the arrows already show.

## Colour is a discrete ramp, not continuous

`pred_dist_to_tg_grid` on `turbo` binned at `OFFSET_BOUNDS`
`[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 20, 40]`. Discrete because a continuous ramp cannot be
read back to a number off a 3-inch panel, and the first three bins are the
ring tiers `classify.summarize` already counts, so the map and the bars agree
on their vocabulary. Caveat: an offset above 40 takes turbo's over-colour and
is indistinguishable from the 20-40 bin; the true maximum is in every panel
title and in the CSV twin (the observed maximum on as01-03 is 35, as01/SPO).

## Known limitation: labels are repelled from labels, not from markers

`place_labels` is a spring-repulsion relaxation between the count labels. It
knows nothing about the prediction markers, so in the dense north-east cluster
(NYC / Philadelphia / DC / Boston, four seeds inside ~2 degrees) a count can
come to rest on top of a marker, and two leader lines can cross. The numbers
are still correct -- they are in the CSV twin -- but the drawing is locally
ambiguous. Not fixed here. The candidates, in the order they are worth trying:

1. add the markers to the repulsion as fixed obstacles, so a label is pushed
   off a prediction the same way it is pushed off another label. `place_labels`
   grew an `obstacles=` argument for `figure_contest_map`, which does exactly
   this; it is not passed here, because turning it on would move every count on
   a figure the paper already cites. Flip it deliberately, not incidentally;
2. allocate labels by angle around the cluster centroid instead of relaxing
   them independently, which makes non-crossing leaders a guarantee rather
   than an outcome;
3. a callout column beside the panel for the densest cluster, with the map
   carrying only a tick -- the only one of the three that scales past ~6 seeds
   in a degree.

One deliberate deviation from the prototype this was ported from:
`place_labels` there left **exactly coincident** anchors coincident forever
(their separation direction is 0/0, so no push exists). Real seeds are
distinct, so the figure is unchanged, but the routine is now total: a
degenerate pair gets a deterministic antisymmetric direction (`_TIE_AXIS`).

Command: `plot-outcome-map`. Needs `build-answer-space` and `classify` on
every run. Writes `_cross/outcome-map/<datasets>[@<arm>]/`.
