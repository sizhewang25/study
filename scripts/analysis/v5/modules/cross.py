"""Where cross-dataset figures land, and what they refuse to pool.

Ported from v4, then split along a seam v4 does not have. Naming a pooled
artifact is two jobs with opposite requirements, and the ported code conflated
them:

* **Identity** -- the directory a pool writes to, and the namespace its sites
  live in. Needs uniqueness and nothing else.
* **Display** -- a panel title, a CSV `dataset` column, a LaTeX caption. Wants
  brevity.

Brevity was the only reason to parse, and parsing is what broke. v4's
`short_dataset` read the dataset off the run id by splitting on the first
hyphen, which assumes the shape `<dataset>-<arm>`; `pro-as01-mesh` and
`pro-as02-mesh` both read `pro`. So the two jobs now have separate answers:

* Display comes from `labels.dataset_label` -- declared in the config, under
  `analysis.common.dataset_label`, falling back to the run id.
* Identity comes from a hash of the run ids (`cross_dir`) and from the run id
  itself (`sites.site_key`). Neither can collapse, whatever a run is called.

The directory is `_cross/<kind>/<n>-runs-<hash>/`, with a `runs.json` beside
the artifacts because a hash does not read as anything. It replaced
`<datasets>@<arm>`, where `arm` was the run-id remainder every run shared:
that existed to stop the mesh and traffic-weighted arms of one dataset set
overwriting each other under a heads-only name, and the hash does it without
parsing.

## ...or the group's name, under `--group`

When the CLI runs with `--group <id>` (`use_group`), a pool whose runs are
exactly a set of the group's roles is named after them instead of hashed:
`<id>` for every member, `<id>.<role>` for one role, `<id>.<a>+<b>` for a
union of roles in the file's order. Any other run set still hashes, so a
hand-picked `--run-id` subset can never land in the group's directory. A
group-named directory is not content-addressed, so `cross_dir` refuses one
whose `runs.json` names different runs (the group's membership was edited):
delete it and rebuild.

Three guards, all strict: a method must be scored in every run, no TG id may
appear in two runs, and no two runs may display the same label. The first two
keep the pooled denominator one population; the third keeps a `groupby` on the
display name honest, since a declared label is free text.
