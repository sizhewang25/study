"""Interactive per-fold LTD fit viewer -- what the latency-to-distance stage learned.

Every other v5 command scores a *prediction*. This one looks at the stage that
produces it: for each fold and each VP, the RTT-vs-distance training scatter, the
2/3*c baseline, and the band the fitted model actually returns. It is the figure
to open when a run's accuracy moves and the question is whether the LTD fit is
the cause.

One self-contained HTML per method, because the method *is* the model -- each page
answers "how does this LTD behave?". That also matches `map_mtl`'s
`mtl_map.{method}.html` and keeps each file near the ~4 MB the existing viewer
already weighs.

## Neither partition enters this page

v5 grades a prediction on two axes, the HEALPix grid and the Voronoi cell. An LTD
fit is upstream of both: it maps an RTT to a distance, with no answer space in
sight. So this module reads no `build-answer-space` output, takes no `--nside`,
and writes to a rung-free directory (`paths.ltd_model_dir`). It is the one v5
command that needs nothing from `classify`.

## Three things make this work

  * **The model is named, not guessed.** `run.json` records `ltd` + `ltd_kwargs`
    per combo. The combo id cannot be pattern-matched: `octant_cbg_spl` and
    `octant_cbg_hull` are both `bounded_spline`, differing only in `fit_spline`.

  * **One uniform prediction API.** The band comes from
    `LTDModel.predict(vp_id, vp_coord, latency).tg_distance`, which every variant
    implements. Nothing here touches a private attribute except the optional
    centre line, which is guarded.

  * **The scatter is found, not assumed.** It is not in the output tree at all
    (see `load_fit_samples`).

## Benchmark names stay benchmark names

`targets.parquet`'s columns (`target_id`, `target_lat`, `target_lon`) and
`run.json`'s keys (`n_targets`, `n_fit_samples`) are written by the benchmark
layer. They are read under those names and emitted into the payload as `tg_*` --
the same boundary `answer_space.BENCHMARK_TG_COLUMNS` draws, rather than a rename
applied halfway up the stack.
