"""Interactive per-TG map of one method's MTL output against both partitions.

The v5 figures are static: they show a distribution, not a case. This is the
case viewer -- pick a TG and read, on one map, every quantity the two verdicts
are made of:

  - the **grid axis**: the truth's grid and its ring-1 and ring-2 neighbours,
    drawn as the HEALPix grids they actually are, plus the grid the prediction
    landed in, so "correct" is a region you can see rather than a rank you have
    to trust;
  - the **cell axis**: the Voronoi cell of every seed, and in particular the
    TG's own cell against the cell the prediction fell in -- which is exactly
    what `cell_label` compares;
  - every VP's **LTD constraint** (disk, or annulus when the LTD emits a lower
    bound) and the **MTL feasible region** those constraints intersect to;
  - the **prediction** and the **truth**, joined by the error.

## Both partitions, because neither is a verdict alone

v4 drew one partition and called the Voronoi overlay context. v5 grades on
both, so this viewer draws both and says so. The cells are **unbounded**: every
point on Earth is nearest to some seed, so `cell_label` on its own will call a
prediction correct at any distance -- the Canadian Arctic case `classify`
documents. The grid axis is what bounds it. Read them together.

## The grid axis is an exact offset, banded here

`classify` writes `pred_dist_to_tg_grid`: exact grid steps, uncapped, with `-1`
meaning "no prediction" and nothing else. This module bands it into the same
five statuses `summarize` counts -- `ring0`, `ring1`, `ring2`, `beyond`,
`failed` -- via `status_of`, so the map and the outcome bars cannot disagree
about one TG.

What the popup prints, though, is the **offset itself**. `beyond` spans 3 to 68
grids out on these runs, and a case viewer whose whole job is one TG should say
"14 grids out" rather than repeat the bucket name.

**The drawn neighbourhood stays capped at `classify.MAX_RING`.** `ring_grids`
grows a disk, and the disk at offset 68 is some 15,000 grids -- undrawable, and
meaningless as a shaded region. Past the second ring the offset is a number and
a status, never a polygon.

## What is read, and what is rebuilt

The **answer space is loaded**, not rebuilt: `build-answer-space` must have run.
v4's viewer rebuilt it in-process and advertised that it ran on a bare
benchmark run. That property is not worth keeping here, because a v5 seed is a
complete-linkage cluster centroid rather than a closed-form pixel centre --
rebuilding risks drawing cells that are not the cells `classify` scored, which
is the one thing a case viewer must never do.

The **scoring is still in-process** (`classify.score_method`), because the
nested constraint columns have to ride through it on the same frame. So the map
still cannot disagree with `accuracy.csv`.

The **MTL feasible region is recomputed**: it is never serialized by the
benchmark. `mtl_participants[]` carries `vp_id`, `rtt_ms`, `echoed_upper_km`,
`echoed_lower_km`, `vp_lat`, `vp_lon` inline -- exactly an `LTDResult` -- so
replaying `MTL_REGISTRY[run.json["mtl"]](**mtl_kwargs)` over the participants
reproduces the bench-time region.

The **LTD cutoff is read from the fold's `fit_checkpoint.pkl`**, the only place
that fitted value is kept. Constraints whose RTT is past it are drawn as their
own layer: there the band is Octant/Spotter's sentinel extension (outer bound
parallel to 2/3*c, inner held at its cutoff value), not the fit.

Output is a **single self-contained HTML** per method: Plotly from CDN, payload
inlined, no sibling JSON, so it opens over `file://` with no web server.

Command: `plot-mtl-map`. Needs `build-answer-space`.

#:
#: That boundary is **not** a half-plane -- a fitted predicate gave 13

#: Spotter's 64.57N one; and it is roughly 2x CONUS on both axes, so the frame

#: back in lon/lat. It also makes the seed-keyed table 274 KiB at 18 seeds and
