"""How consistent each method is across the replicas of one site.

Two figures over the same three pooled meshes, written side by side so a
paper can place them independently. They do **not** share a denominator: the
success ratio counts the 61 Voronoi cells, the spread counts the 65 sites.
See `UNIT` for why.

* `paired_ratio_of_success` -- the distribution over **cells** of the share of
  a cell's targets the method put in the correct cell. Spotter is
  all-or-nothing on 57 of 61 cells; Octant-Hull on 35, splitting the other 26.
* `paired_std_grid_offset` -- the standard deviation of `pred_dist_to_tg_grid`
  across a site's targets, in grid steps. Spotter's median is 0.31 grids
  against Octant-Hull's 1.22, and it is perfectly consistent on 21 sites
  against 5.

## The ratio figure is a CDF, after two failed violins

A success ratio lives on [0, 1] and these pile up on both ends: 61 of
Spotter's 65 sites sit at exactly 0 or exactly 1. A violin over that was
wrong twice -- Scott's bandwidth invented a waist as wide as Octant-Hull's
where Spotter has four split sites, and bounding the KDE by clipping the drawn
body left a shape that did not read as a violin at all.

A share of 65 sites concentrated on two values has no shape a smoother can be
trusted with, so it is drawn as an empirical CDF: exact, no bins, no
bandwidth, no choices. The claim is in the geometry. The jump at 0 is the
share of sites the method missed entirely, the jump at 1 the share it swept,
and the two together are its unanimity rate -- 93.8% against 60.0%. Between
them Spotter's curve is flat and Octant-Hull's climbs, and that flatness *is*
the finding rather than a stand-in for it.

## The one claim here that is about the estimator

Every other figure in this family compares two methods on the unbounded cell
metric, which the evaluation section argues is broken. This one does not:
answering ~20 byte-identical coordinates the same way is a property of the
estimator, and it would read the same under any scoring rule.
`paired_std_grid_offset` does not mention `cell_label` at all.

## Spread of what, and in what units

The standard deviation of the grid *error distance* across a site's targets.
It is the spread of the error magnitude rather than of the answers, so two
replicas five grids out in opposite directions read as perfect agreement --
a known limitation, measured and accepted rather than overlooked. See
`contest.offset_spread` for the number it costs.

Grid steps, not kilometres. A spread in kilometres invites comparison against
an error distance, and this figure is deliberately not about accuracy: a site
whose twenty replicas all sit 38 grids out scores 0, perfectly stable and
consistently ~1,900 km wrong. as01 has such a site.

## And the part that cuts the other way

Spotter is *more often* perfectly consistent and *worse* when it is not: its
per-site spread on the as01-03 meshes ran to 15.8 grids where Octant-Hull's
stopped at 6.5 (the manifest's caveat quotes the current `spread_max`). The
whiskers are the 5th and 95th percentiles and no outliers are drawn, so
**that tail is not on the page**. It is in the twin and the manifest as
`spread_max`, and anyone quoting "more stable" from this figure alone would be
quoting the middle of a distribution whose tail says the opposite.

## Solved rows only, stated once

Both panels use `status.solved_mask`: a FALLBACK row carries the shortest-ping
baseline's coordinate, so its offset describes the baseline's consistency
rather than the method's. On these meshes Spotter and Octant-Hull never fall
back, so the two readings coincide -- the rule is fixed here because it will
not always, and Vanilla is the method it bites.

A site with fewer than two solved rows has no spread to report and is absent
from the spread figure rather than drawn at zero, which would read as perfect
agreement. The count of such sites is in the manifest.

Command: `plot-stability`. Needs `build-answer-space` and `classify` on every
run. Writes a PNG, CSV twin and manifest per figure into
`_cross/stability/<datasets>[@<arm>]/`.
