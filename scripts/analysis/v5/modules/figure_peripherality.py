"""How far out the sites each method wins sit: two boxes, one axis.

The contest map shows *where* the two methods win. This reduces that to one
number per site -- its distance from the run's seed-cloud centroid -- and
contrasts the two win categories on a single axis.

The finding it backs: Spotter's wins are exclusively peripheral. Not mostly,
exclusively -- its nearest win on these meshes is 1,018 km out, and its lower
quartile sits above Octant-Hull's median. Octant-Hull wins from 98 km out and
its box spans nearly the whole range. Two boxes make that a shape rather than
a pair of quoted numbers.

## What is measured, from what, to what

Great-circle, from a site's **seed** to the spherical centroid of **all** that
run's seeds. Both ends are points of the answer space, which is what makes the
number coherent: it says where a serving region sits, not where a target
happens to sit inside one. Sites grouped under one seed share a value -- as01
has 18 seeds over 20 sites.

The origin is the seeds' and not the site set's: a mesh whose sites happen to
cluster would otherwise move the thing it is being measured against. It is
found by `geodesy.spherical_centroid`, which is how `seeds` places each seed
over the sites it groups -- one notion of centre in the package.

Not in EPSG:5070. The partition is defined by great-circle nearest seed and
`classify` uses no projection; the plane exists only so `cells` can draw the
partition, and peripherality is a property of the partition rather than of
the drawing. See `contest.seed_cloud_centroid_km` for what the difference measures out
at -- small enough that no claim here turns on it, which is the point.

## The axis is normalised, and the kilometres are in the twin

Min-max over **all 65 pooled sites**, including the tied and neither ones that
are not drawn -- so the axis is "position within the observed range of site
peripherality" and 0 and 1 are real sites rather than round numbers. A reader
cannot quote a normalised axis, so the CSV twin carries every site's raw
kilometres alongside, and the manifest carries the two constants and the
per-category quantiles in both units.

## Two boxes, not four

`tied` and `neither` are in the twin and off the figure. They are concordant
outcomes and carry no direction, and drawing four boxes to compare two of them
puts the contrast this figure exists for on a third of the page.

## The seed, or the cell it owns

A seed's distance is not the same as its cell's. A peripheral seed can own a
large cell reaching back in toward the centre: as01's Seattle seed is 2,349 km
out and its cell begins at 1,241. Measured, the two rank the 65 sites only at
Spearman 0.87 -- a real difference, not a rounding one.

It is not what produces the contrast. The inward reach is the same size in
both categories (median 404 km where Spotter wins, 333 where Octant-Hull
does), and the claim holds under either measure: by cell reach, Spotter never
wins a site whose region begins within 770 km of the centre, while
Octant-Hull wins one whose region *contains* it. The seed distance is the
simpler quantity and the one the contest map keys on, so it is the one drawn.

## What this does not separate

On a CONUS answer space, distance from the centroid is nearly collinear with
"coastal". This figure cannot tell the two apart and must not be read as
having done so. And 21 sites against 20 is the whole sample: the three meshes
share facilities, so even that is not 41 independent observations.

Command: `plot-peripherality`. Needs `build-answer-space` and `classify` on
every run. Writes `_cross/peripherality/<datasets>[@<arm>]/`.
