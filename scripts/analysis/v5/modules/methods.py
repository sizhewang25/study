"""Method terms, labels and hues -- the one lookup table every v5 figure uses.

Methods are named by a **short term** everywhere in v5: axis labels, legends,
manifests and prose. `METHOD_TERMS` is the lookup table from term to full
name; `METHOD_LABELS` maps each benchmark combo id onto its term.

| term  | full name             | combo id(s)                       |
|-------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| OCT-H | Octant-Hull CBG       | octant_cbg_hull                   |
| OCT-S | Octant-Spline CBG     | octant_cbg_spl, octant_cbg        |
| SOI   | Speed-of-Internet CBG | million_scale_cbg                 |
| S-P   | Shortest-Ping         | shortest_ping                     |
| SPO   | Spotter CBG           | spotter_cbg                       |
| VAN   | Vanilla CBG           | vanilla_cbg                       |

Colour is pinned to a method's **identity**, never to its rank in the current
selection, so `--method` cannot repaint the survivors and the same variant is
the same colour in every figure. The hexes are v4's (and v3's), re-keyed on the
terms.

`TERM_ORDER` applies the same rule to position: legends and tables list methods
in one fixed order, so a method sits in the same row of every figure and the
reader compares down a column instead of re-reading the key each time.
