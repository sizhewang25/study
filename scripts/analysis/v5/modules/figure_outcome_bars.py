"""Outcome composition bars: cell label first, then ring tier.

Each bar is one method's **entire** TG set, stacked bottom-up by cell label

    correct | wrong | no answer

In `bounded` mode each *answered* group is broken down by ring tier (ring0,
ring1, ring2, beyond): the bar's primary split answers "did the prediction
land in the TG's serving region?", the breakdown answers "and how far off?".
It is the same cross-tab classify writes (`n_<tier>_cell_<label>`); grouping
by cell label first puts the operator's first question on the bar's main
division.

In `unbounded` mode the breakdown is dropped and the cell axis is drawn alone
-- the plain nearest-seed verdict, with nothing bounding how far a `correct`
may be. The pair is the argument: same predictions, same denominator, and a
method can lead on serving region while holding no ring0 at all.

## Encoding

* **Colour = ring tier**: green (in the TG grid), light blue (1 ring out),
  light purple (2 rings out), light grey (further out -- ungraded, so no
  hue), dark grey (no answer). See `TIER_INK` for the reasoning and the
  validation.
* **Stripe = cell label** in `bounded`: plain for `correct`, `//` for
  `wrong`. A stripe rather than a second hue, because hue is already spent on
  the ring tier; the empty pattern is the good outcome, so the eye reads
  stripes as "something went wrong". Stripes are white on dark fills and ink
  on light ones, by the same rule as the labels. In `unbounded` the colour
  *is* the cell label (`MODE_INK`) and the stripe merely reinforces it.
* **A thicker border around each cell-label group**, "no answer" included,
  so a group's ring breakdown reads as one unit. Every group takes the same
  border, so no segment gains apparent width -- in a stacked share chart width
  is quantitative. Sub-segments have no stroke of their own.
* Inside a group, a **white line** separates the ring tiers -- interior
  boundaries only, drawn as lines across the bar.
* Every sub-segment above `_LABEL_FLOOR` prints **its own share**, on a solid
  chip so the stripe never runs through the digits; thinner slivers stay in
  the CSV twin.
* A **rail** right of each bar carries one segment per cell-label group,
  white with that group's stripe and a border, and the group's **total**
  beside it, set vertically in bold ink. Labels of thin adjacent groups are
  nudged apart, never reordered. "No answer" has no rail: it has no
  breakdown, so its in-bar label is its total.

## Order

Each panel ranks itself, descending, on the cumulative key

    (true, true & ring0, true & <=ring1, true & <=ring2)

at the reported precision, so the displayed order follows from the displayed
values: most TGs in their serving region first, and among equals, the one
whose correct-region predictions are tighter. The pooled cross-dataset order
breaks remaining ties.

One exception, `_TIE_FIRST`: S-P and SOI on the same correct-region share
always read SOI first. The ring keys separate them per dataset, which on the
`unbounded` figure -- the cell axis alone -- shows up as a rank flip between
two bars both labelled 42%.

In `compare` each panel is tagged `(a)`, `(b)`, ... left of its dataset, so
the prose can cite one. A lone panel takes no tag, and a panel that pools
several datasets is not headed at all -- `pooled` draws one panel, so the
joined slug over it only repeats the caption.

## What the figure does not draw

No figure title and no method-term caption. Both go in the paper's caption and
prose, and on a figure this short redrawing them cost a third of the height.
The manifest beside the PNG still carries `subject` and `method_terms`.

## Layouts and pooling

As v4. `compare` is one panel per dataset; `pooled` is one panel over every
input run's TGs, a micro-average recounted from the per-TG parquets by
`classify.summarize`. Coverage is strict and TG ids must be disjoint across
runs.

Command: `plot-outcome-bars`. Needs `classify` on every run.
