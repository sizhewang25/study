# Runs are handled in GROUPS. Every cross-dataset figure pools its inputs into
# one population, so a group is a set of runs it is meaningful to pool: three
# meshes of three different ASNs, yes; a mesh and its own traffic-weighted
# subset, no -- the weighted arm is a subset of the same targets, so pooling
# them would count a site twice and compare a dataset against itself.
#
# v4's script split the same way and called the groups `--mesh`/`--weighted`,
# because its output directory was `<datasets>@<arm>` and the arm was the only
# thing keeping the two from overwriting each other. v5 does not need that:
# `cross.cross_dir` writes `_cross/<kind>/<n>-runs-<hash>/` over the run set
# itself, so two groups cannot collide whatever they are called. The grouping
# that survives is the statistical one, which is why the flag is now just
# `--group`.
#
# Deliberately NOT `set -e`. Per-run commands are largely independent and a run
# with a half-finished benchmark will fail several of them; aborting on the
# first failure would hide the state of every later run. Failures are collected
# and printed as a summary instead, and the script exits non-zero if any
# occurred.
#
# Every command is addressed by `--run-id` against the benchmark output tree. A
# run id with no tree under outputs/benchmark/v2/ is a SKIP, not a failure.
