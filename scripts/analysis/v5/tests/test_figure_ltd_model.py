"""What the LTD viewer must not get wrong about a fit it did not perform.

The scatter is reconstructed for the operator runs rather than read back, and
the band is evaluated against a pickled model -- so the invariants worth pinning
are the ones that would otherwise fail *silently*: a scatter that is not the set
the model saw, a declined RTT rendered as a real prediction, and a page whose JS
never runs.

Neither v5 partition appears here, and that is the point: an LTD fit is upstream
of both, so there is no answer space to build and no nside to sweep.
