"""Method display names and hues — the vocabulary every v4 figure shares.

Two figures now draw the same six methods (`figure_outcome_bars`,
`figure_euler`), so the names and colours live here rather than in whichever
module needed them first. A variant named or coloured two ways across two
figures of the same sweep is the failure this prevents.

Colour is pinned to a method's **identity**, never to its rank in the current
selection, so `--method` cannot repaint the survivors and the same variant is
the same colour in every figure.

#: Label -> hue. Keyed on the *label* rather than the combo id so
#: `octant_cbg_spl` and `octant_cbg` land on one colour: they are one paper
#: variant whose id differs per run.
#:
#: Carried over unchanged from v3's validated palette (`validate_palette.js
#: --mode light --surface #ffffff --pairs all`): hue carries family and
#: lightness carries the variant within it, so the two Octant arms share a
#: green and separate by 30+ dE under every colour-vision simulation. Worst
#: cross-method CVD separation is dE 8.6 (Spotter vs Octant-Hull, deutan) and
#: the normal-vision floor is 16.3. Re-validate before changing any hex.
#:
#: Deliberately identical to v3's hexes. The two layers score different things
#: and their numbers must not be mixed, but a reader moving between a v3 figure
#: and a v4 one is looking at the same six *methods*, and repainting them would
#: cost that recognition for nothing.
