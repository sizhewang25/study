"""TrafficWeightedCSVSource — K-fold on a mesh, evaluated on the traffic-weighted subset.

Subclasses `GenericCSVSource`, so the canonical column contract, the slice
grammar (`all` / `head<k>` / `fold_N`), DistGeo stratification and `min_obs` are
all inherited unchanged. The one thing added is an eval-side mask.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
The traffic mask touches the eval side only. Fit is whatever the slice's fit
partition is -- under `fold_N`, the other K-1 folds' targets -- and those targets
keep **every flow they have**: the mask never removes an edge from training.
Eval is the slice's own targets intersected with the targets that survive
traffic filtering, scored on their surviving flows only.

That is the §7.3 protocol: K-fold handles data scarcity, the fold boundary
handles leakage, and traffic restricts only what is scored.

THE WEIGHTED SUBSET IS A SET OF FLOWS, NOT A THRESHOLD
------------------------------------------------------
Both modes converge on one object -- a set of `(vp_id, target_id)` keys:

  precomputed   `weighted_csv_path` given -> the set is exactly the flows
                present in that file, whatever produced it.
  on-the-fly    no path -> derive a threshold from the mesh via
                `eval_kept_traffic_fraction` / `eval_pair_weight_min`, and the
                set is the flows clearing it.

Membership rather than a re-derived threshold, because §7.3 says "keep only the
flows that appear in the traffic-weighted dataset" -- a set, not a number -- and
because it stays correct for a weighted CSV produced by a rule this code does
not know about.

Two consequences worth knowing:

  * Precomputed mode consults no weights at all, so the mesh needs no `weight`
    column. On-the-fly mode does, and refuses a weightless mesh (see below).
  * The two modes are interchangeable at the same fraction: running
    `derive_traffic_weighted_cbg_data.smk` at 0.95 and passing its output is
    equivalent to passing `eval_kept_traffic_fraction: 0.95`, because both run
    the same keyless whole-mesh derivation. Use precomputed when you also need
    the CSV for plotting or dataset characterisation; use on-the-fly for sweeps
    where materializing a file per fraction is wasteful.

Source kwargs:
  mesh_csv_path      : Path | str   — required; the full mesh CSV. Fit draws
                       from it, and it is the universe the subset lives in.
  weighted_csv_path  : Path | str   — precomputed subset. Mutually exclusive
                       with the two threshold kwargs.
  eval_pair_weight_min : float      — on-the-fly: keep flows with
                       `weight >= this`.
  eval_kept_traffic_fraction : float — on-the-fly: KEYLESS, WHOLE-MESH
                       derivation of that threshold. `total` sums `weight` over
                       every row in the mesh (not just eval-side rows, and not
                       deduped by any key); flows are ranked descending and
                       cumulated, and the smallest prefix reaching
                       `frac * total` fixes the threshold. Whole-mesh
                       normalization is what makes the threshold
                       FOLD-INDEPENDENT -- every `fold_N` of one mesh derives
                       the same number, so folds stay comparable and "survived
                       traffic filtering" is a property of the traffic rather
                       than of the partition. Mesh weights are typically shares
                       of a larger universe (the mesh itself samples top targets
                       per location) and need not sum to 1; renormalizing by the
                       mesh total is what makes the fraction meaningful.
  k / seed / asn_bucket_top_n / min_obs / fold_by — as `GenericCSVSource`.
                       With `fold_by: site`, a fold whose site keeps no
                       weighted flow raises at load (no eval targets).
